    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I'm a self-taught full stack web developer with close to 3 years of
      professional experience. I specialize in building responsive and
      performant web applications using
      <strong>SvelteKit</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>,
      <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and <strong>GraphQL</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
      My journey began as a career changer — without formal CS education — and
      I’ve since contributed to real-world production apps, worked in agile
      teams, and built a solid foundation in modern web technologies.
