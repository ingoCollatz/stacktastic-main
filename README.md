# Stacktastic

A modern web application designed for rapid development, easy deployment, and maintainable code.

## About

Stacktastic is a personal portfolio site and project showcase built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind â€” containerized with Docker and deployed using Traefik on a Hetzner server.

## Getting Started

   cd stacktastic-main
   ```
2. Install dependencies (choose one):
